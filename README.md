# Frogger_Assembly

This code was written in Whitworth's CS-274 Assembler Programming and models the popular computer game Frogger.  The player uses WASD controls to hop their green frog-block through a maze of cars and logs in order to make it to the finish line.

What did I do:  For this project, I was in charge of debugging.  My groupmates and I would work through the logic together, they would code it, and when it didn't work, I would fix it.  With Assembly being not the most popular option out right now for developers, this was EXTREMELY difficult. We basically did the whole project by overselves, only with the help of our nifty textbook.

Why did I include this:  Although I can't show you how I debugged something, I included the code to reiderate the complexity of this problem.  Every ideration of the loop was a reset of the entire screen; we had to have complete control over the stack and the registers in order to get our code to do what we wanted it to do.  Above all else, I believe this kind of thing shows determination.  It's really easy to get super down and out when your code doesn't work first try, but I will always try a second, third, fourth time to get my code up and running.  The demo is worth every feeling of regret along the way!
